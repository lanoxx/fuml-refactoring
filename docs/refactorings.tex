\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
In this work we will present some ideas and concepts for refactoring fUML with EMF. The main contribution of this work is the extension of
existing UML refactorings to cover not only the static aspect of UML such as class diagrams but also include refactorings for dynamic
parts such as activity diagrams. In this work we will present basic concepts for refactoring with EMF and show how model semantics can be
preserved through the use of OCL constraints. Finally we conclude with a discussion of EMF.Refactor, which shows how such refactorings
can be included into Eclipse GUIs such as EMF tree editor or Papyrus.

\section{Introduction}
fUML adds semantics to UML models that make it possible to create semantically closed models which can be executed on the model level. With
fUML classic refactorings are not enough to refactor those models as they do not support the refactoring of the dynamic aspects of models
such as activity diagrams.

\section{Refactorings Examples}
In this section we will present some general refactorings such as the ``extract superclass'' refactoring.

\section{Refactoring of fUML diagrams}
In this section we will present the extension of our uml refactorings to fUML activity diagrams.

\section{Related Works}
